## Detailed Evaluation

### composer-1
- **Functionality:** 7/10 — All core features except edit. Add/toggle/delete/spin/confetti/modal work. Requires 2+ names to spin.
- **Visual Design:** 7.5/10 — Good dark mode (#1a1a1a), purple gradient spin button, red pointer. Clean but uses generic system fonts.
- **Code Quality:** 7.5/10 — Clean vanilla JS, good state management, proper event handlers.
- **Innovation:** 5/10 — Basic implementation, no extra features.
- **Overall Score:** 7.0/10
- **Notes:** Missing edit functionality for existing names. Would benefit from double-click or inline edit.

### claude-4.5-opus-high
- **Functionality:** 9.5/10 — Complete: add/edit(dblclick)/toggle/delete/spin/confetti/modal. Pre-populated demo names.
- **Visual Design:** 9.5/10 — Excellent! Subtle animated gradients, custom SVG pointer, Outfit + JetBrains Mono fonts, cyan/magenta/amber palette, elegant toggles.
- **Code Quality:** 9/10 — CSS variables, well-organized, smooth animations, clean JS structure.

## Key Findings

### What Worked Well
- All models successfully implemented dark mode with appropriate color schemes
- Confetti animations were universally implemented and effective
- Most models included pre-populated demo names for immediate testing
- Post-spin modal with Keep/Disable worked across all implementations
- Canvas-based wheel rendering was consistent

### Common Issues
- 2/10 models (composer-1, grok-code-fast-1) missing edit functionality
- Most models use system fonts; only Claude models and GPT-5.1-high used distinctive typography
- Few models implemented localStorage persistence (only gpt-5.2 variants)
- Long name handling varies - some truncate, others allow overflow

### Interesting Variations
- **gpt-5.2-xhigh-fast**: Bulk add via textarea, toast notifications, prefers-reduced-motion support
- **gpt-5.2**: Winner segment highlight glow on wheel
- **gemini-3-pro**: Emoji-based toggle icons (👁️/🚫), shuffle feature
- **claude-4.5-opus/haiku**: Custom SVG pointer, animated background gradients
- **gpt-5.1-codex-high-fast**: Stats dashboard with enabled/disabled/total counts

## Conclusions

### Top Performers
1. **gpt-5.2-xhigh-fast (9.5/10)** - Most feature-complete with bulk add, localStorage, toasts, and excellent accessibility
2. **claude-4.5-opus-high (9.0/10)** - Best visual design with custom pointer, animated gradients, and polished aesthetics
3. **gpt-5.1-codex-high-fast (8.8/10)** - Very polished with stats dashboard and inline editing

### Areas for Improvement
- Edit functionality should be a baseline requirement - 2 models missed this
- More models should implement localStorage for persistence
- Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, aria labels) could be more consistent
- Long name handling should be standardized (truncate with ellipsis)

### Recommendations for Next Evaluation
- Add explicit "Edit existing names" requirement in prompt
- Test localStorage persistence as a specific criterion
- Include accessibility as a scoring category
- Test with very long names to check truncation handling
- Consider adding mobile responsiveness as evaluation criteria
