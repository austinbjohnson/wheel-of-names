## Detailed Evaluation

### Claude 4.5 Opus
- **Functionality:** 10/10 — All features complete: add, inline edit, toggle enable/disable, delete, smooth spin with cubic-bezier deceleration, correct winner calculation, confetti, modal with Keep/Disable. Handles edge cases (empty state, requires 2+ names).
- **Visual Design:** 10/10 — Stunning dark mode (#0d0d0f). Animated rainbow outer ring, radial gradient slices, Space Mono + Outfit fonts, glow effects, responsive grid layout, beautiful modal with backdrop blur.
- **Code Quality:** 9/10 — Clean separation of concerns, CSS custom properties, HTML escaping for XSS prevention, well-organized event listeners, excellent animation timing.
- **Innovation:** 10/10 — Animated conic-gradient ring rotating behind wheel, inline editing with save/cancel buttons, confetti physics simulation with gravity/drag, color dot indicators in name list matching wheel colors.
- **Overall Score:** 9.5/10
- **Notes:** The most polished implementation. Exceptional attention to detail with features like inline editing, toggle switches, and the animated outer ring. Winner alignment verified correct.

### Claude 4.5 Sonnet
- **Functionality:** 8/10 — All core features work: add, edit (via `prompt()`), toggle, delete (with `confirm()`), spin, confetti, modal. Pre-populated with sample names.
- **Visual Design:** 7/10 — Good dark mode (#1a1a1a), purple/pink gradient accents, clean grid layout. Uses system fonts—functional but less distinctive.
- **Code Quality:** 8/10 — Clean, straightforward implementation. Good state management.
- **Innovation:** 6/10 — Solid but standard implementation. Uses DOM-based CSS confetti animation.
- **Overall Score:** 7.5/10
- **Notes:** Reliable implementation that covers all requirements. Using `prompt()` and `confirm()` for edit/delete feels dated compared to inline UI. Confetti works via CSS keyframes on dynamically created elements.

### Claude 4.5 Haiku
- **Functionality:** 5/10 — Add names works. Missing edit feature (only Remove/Enable/Disable). Spin animation appears broken—wheel doesn't visually rotate, winner is randomly determined without proper alignment. Confetti animation is janky (position jumps randomly).
- **Visual Design:** 6/10 — Dark mode (#1a1a1a), vibrant cyan/pink accents. Simpler layout, smaller wheel. Basic but functional styling.
- **Code Quality:** 5/10 — Simpler codebase. Confetti animation logic is flawed (top value not properly animated). Missing promised edit feature.
- **Innovation:** 3/10 — Minimal—basic implementation without standout features.
- **Overall Score:** 5.0/10
- **Notes:** Critical issues with spin animation—the wheel canvas doesn't actually rotate visually, making winner selection feel arbitrary. No edit functionality provided. Most limited implementation of the group.

### GPT-5.1 Codex High Fast
- **Functionality:** 7/10 — Add, toggle, delete all work. Missing edit feature. Physics-based spin animation with velocity/friction is excellent. Uses canvas-confetti library. Modal works correctly.
- **Visual Design:** 7/10 — Dark mode (#1a1a1a), cyan accent color, clean layout with styled scrollbars. Uses emoji icons (👁️ 🚫 ❌) for actions—polarizing choice.
- **Code Quality:** 8/10 — Clean implementation. Good physics simulation for wheel spin (velocity decays with friction). Relies on external CDN library for confetti.
- **Innovation:** 7/10 — Realistic physics-based wheel spin using velocity and friction constants. Modal animation on show. Pre-populated with diverse sample names.
- **Overall Score:** 7.0/10
- **Notes:** The physics-based spin feels the most "real" of all implementations. External dependency on canvas-confetti.js is a consideration. Missing edit feature drops the score.

### Gemini 3 Pro
- **Functionality:** 8/10 — Add, inline edit (via contenteditable-style input), toggle via custom switch, delete. Smooth spin animation. Canvas-based confetti. Modal with Keep/Disable. Saves to localStorage (persistence across sessions).
- **Visual Design:** 9/10 — Excellent "Midnight Edition" dark theme (#03050c). Beautiful gradient backgrounds, hero section with feature pills, custom toggle switches, Inter font, status card showing current result. Very polished.
- **Code Quality:** 9/10 — Excellent organization with IIFE wrapper. localStorage persistence. Proper ARIA accessibility labels. Keyboard support (ESC to close). Clean modular structure.
- **Innovation:** 9/10 — localStorage persistence, hero pill badges, result status card, accessibility features, keyboard navigation. "Midnight Edition" branding adds personality.
- **Overall Score:** 8.5/10
- **Notes:** ⚠️ Pointer is at TOP but uses `border-bottom` in CSS which typically creates a downward arrow. Need to verify pointer/winner alignment in live testing. If aligned correctly, this would be a 9/10. Excellent feature set with localStorage saving state between sessions.

### Composer 1
- **Functionality:** 7/10 — Add, toggle, delete work. No dedicated edit button (name text is inline but not editable). Spin uses CSS transform on canvas. Confetti is DOM-based with CSS animation. Modal works.
- **Visual Design:** 8/10 — Dark mode with gradient (#1a1a1a → #2a2a2a), rainbow gradient title, pulsing spin button animation, backdrop blur on modal. Nice visual polish.
- **Code Quality:** 7/10 — Clean code. Uses CSS transform for wheel rotation while drawing is canvas-based—potential for rotation/drawing mismatch.
- **Innovation:** 7/10 — Pulsing spin button animation, gradient rainbow text effects, blur backdrop modal.
- **Overall Score:** 7.5/10
- **Notes:** Good visual presentation with the pulsing spin button and gradient text. Hybrid approach (canvas draw + CSS transform rotate) works but could have edge cases. Missing edit feature.

### Grok Code Fast 1
- **Functionality:** 6/10 — Add, toggle, delete work. No edit feature. Uses canvas drawing + CSS transform rotation (hybrid approach). Confetti is DOM-based. Modal works.
- **Visual Design:** 6/10 — Dark mode (#1a1a1a), gradient backgrounds, vibrant wheel colors. Standard styling without distinctive features.
- **Code Quality:** 6/10 — Functional but basic. The canvas draw + CSS transform separation could cause winner alignment issues.
- **Innovation:** 4/10 — Standard implementation without standout features.
- **Overall Score:** 6.0/10
- **Notes:** The most basic passing implementation. Hybrid canvas/CSS approach for wheel rotation is concerning for winner alignment accuracy. Missing edit feature. Alert dialog for "need 2 names" instead of disabled button state.

## Key Findings

### What Worked Well
- All models correctly implemented dark mode theme as specified in v3 prompt
- All models included confetti animations on winner selection
- All models provided functional post-spin dialogs with Keep/Disable options
- Most models handled empty state and minimum name requirements gracefully

### Common Issues
- **Missing Edit Feature:** 4 of 7 models (Haiku, GPT, Composer, Grok) omitted the edit functionality
- **Hybrid Rotation Approaches:** Several models drew wheel with canvas but rotated with CSS transforms, creating potential alignment issues
- **External Dependencies:** GPT used external CDN library (canvas-confetti.js)
- **Legacy UI Patterns:** Sonnet used `prompt()` and `confirm()` dialogs instead of inline UI

### Interesting Variations
- **Opus:** Animated rainbow outer ring using conic-gradient rotation
- **Gemini:** localStorage persistence—only model to save state between sessions
- **GPT:** Physics-based spin with velocity/friction (most realistic feel)
- **Opus:** Color dots in name list matching wheel segment colors
- **Gemini:** ARIA accessibility labels throughout

## Conclusions

### Top Performers
1. **Claude 4.5 Opus (9.5/10)** — Best overall with exceptional polish, complete feature set, and innovative touches like the animated outer ring
2. **Gemini 3 Pro (8.5/10)** — Excellent design, localStorage persistence, accessibility focus. Beautiful "Midnight Edition" theme.
3. **Claude 4.5 Sonnet / Composer 1 (7.5/10)** — Solid implementations with good visual design

### Areas for Improvement
- Edit functionality should be emphasized in prompt if required
- Pointer/winner alignment verification needs browser testing
- Consider specifying whether external CDN libraries are allowed
- Haiku's broken spin animation is a significant quality regression

### Recommendations for Next Evaluation
- Add explicit requirement for inline edit (not prompt-based)
- Add test case for long names to verify text truncation/wrapping
- Consider automated browser testing for winner alignment verification
- Track whether localStorage persistence should be a requirement
- Test edge case: what happens with exactly 1 enabled name?
