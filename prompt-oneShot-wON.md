**Build a "Wheel of Names" web app using the official Zapier Brand Guide.**

**Design & Branding:**
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   **Zap Orange:** #FF4F00 (Primary hero color - use for roughly 60% of the design impact)
    *   **Earth:** #201515 (Dark neutral for text and contrast - 20%)
    *   **Cream:** #FFF3E6 (Warm light background/surface - 20%)
    *   **Almost White:** #FFFDF9 (Alternative light background)
    *   **Expanded Palette (for wheel slices):** Moss (#1F3121), Night (#2B2358), Lavender (#C1B7FF), Peach (#FFBF6E), Bolt (#F6FFDB), Sky (#CDE4E1).
*   **Usage:** Zap Orange should be the dominant hero color. Use Earth in place of pure black. Cream provides a warm foundation. The wheel itself should be colorful, utilizing the Expanded Palette for distinct slices, ensuring high contrast with the text (using Earth or Almost White for text depending on slice brightness).

**Core Requirements:**
*   **Input:** Allow users to add, edit, and manage a list of names.
*   **Visuals:** Render a spinning wheel with names in pie slices.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   On spin end: Highlight the selected name clearly and trigger a confetti animation.
    *   Post-spin dialog: Offer options to "Keep" the name or "Disable" it from future spins.
*   **State Management:** Allow users to manually enable/disable specific names from the list at any time without spinning.
