# Wheel of Names - Evaluation Prompt

**Build a "Wheel of Names" web app.**

**Core Requirements:**
*   **Input:** Allow users to add, edit, and manage a list of names.
*   **Visuals:** Render a spinning wheel with names in pie slices.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   On spin end: Highlight the selected name clearly and trigger a confetti animation.
    *   Post-spin dialog: Offer options to "Keep" the name or "Disable" it from future spins.
*   **State Management:** Allow users to manually enable/disable specific names from the list at any time without spinning.
