# Wheel of Names - Evaluation Prompt

**Build a "Wheel of Names" web app with a Dark Mode theme.**

**Design & Branding:**
*   **Theme:** Dark mode by default.
*   **Background:** Dark grays/blacks (e.g., #1a1a1a).
*   **Text:** Light/White for high contrast.
*   **Accents:** Vibrant colors for the wheel and actions to stand out against the dark background.

**Core Requirements:**
*   **Input:** Allow users to add, edit, and manage a list of names.
*   **Visuals:** Render a spinning wheel with names in pie slices.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   On spin end: Highlight the selected name clearly and trigger a confetti animation.
    *   Post-spin dialog: Offer options to "Keep" the name or "Disable" it from future spins.
*   **State Management:** Allow users to manually enable/disable specific names from the list at any time without spinning.
